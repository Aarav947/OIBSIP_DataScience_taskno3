# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
The price of a car depends on several factors such as brand value, year of manufacture, fuel type, mileage, transmission type, and usage. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of a car based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about used cars, including features such as year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details. The target variable is the selling price of the car.

## Approach
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed by handling categorical variables and creating a new feature for car age. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand feature relationships. A Random Forest regression model is trained to predict car prices, and its performance is evaluated using regression metrics.

## Result
The trained model predicts car prices with good accuracy and identifies key factors influencing the selling price, such as car age, present price, and kilometers driven.
